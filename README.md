### Known issues
- I ran out of time to make the NPC move between rooms for the changing environment requirement.
- I ran out of time to create a map with 10 rooms (instead I have 4). Adding rooms to the map is easy, but adding gameplay to those rooms (like adding people and items) would require editing in several places.
- My goal was to have a game class that was completely abstracted from the details of the game. There are still many things that need to be refactored to make it fully abstract (there are areas marked with #TODO where I need to refactor).
- The story of the game wasn't fleshed out.
